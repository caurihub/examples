	"description": "THE AREX ALPHA IS THE NEXT EVOLUTIONARY STEP IN THE AREX HANDGUN FAMILY. IT IS A DIRECT DESCENDANT OF THE AREX ZERO 1 AND HAS INHERITED ITS TOUGHNESS AND RELIABILITY. LISTENING TO THE PRACTICAL SHOOTERS, AREX DESIGNED AND DEVELOPED A PISTOL THAT EXCELS IN COMPETITIVE PRACTICAL SHOOTING AS WELL AS IN TACTICAL SCENARIOS. WITH THE ELUSIVE AND ALL IMPORTANT SHOOTABILITY BEING AREXS PRIMARY GOAL, A STEEL FRAME WAS USED IN PLACE OF AN ALUMINUM ONE. A REENGINEERED GRIP RESULTS IN SHORTER TRIGGER REACH AND NOTABLY HIGHER HAND POSITION. AN UNDERCUT TRIGGER GUARD AND EXTENDED BEAVERTAIL COMPLETE THE ERGONOMIC TRANSFORMATION. THE LONG SLIDE HOUSES A FIVE INCH BARREL, PROVIDING A LONGER LINE OF SIGHT FOR FASTER AND MORE ACCURATE SHOTS. THE SLIDE HAS BEEN LIGHTENED SIGNIFICANTLY UTILIZING LIGHTENING CUTS TO ACCOMPLISH FASTER CYCLING.",
